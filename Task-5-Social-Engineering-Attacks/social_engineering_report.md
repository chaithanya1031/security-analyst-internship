# Task 5: Research Report on Social Engineering Attacks

## Introduction
Social engineering attacks exploit human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities. Attackers manipulate people into revealing confidential information, performing actions, or granting unauthorized access.

This report discusses common social engineering techniques, their impact, real-world examples, and preventive measures.

## 1. Phishing Attacks

### Description
Phishing is a social engineering attack where attackers send fraudulent emails or messages pretending to be from trusted organizations to steal sensitive information.

### How It Works
Attackers send emails containing malicious links or fake login pages that trick users into entering credentials.

### Impact
- Credential theft
- Financial loss
- Identity theft

### Real-World Example
Phishing emails impersonating banks or payment services asking users to “verify” their accounts are widely reported.

### Prevention
- User awareness and training
- Email filtering and spam detection
- Avoid clicking unknown links
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)

## 2. Pretexting Attacks

### Description
Pretexting involves creating a fabricated scenario to convince victims to provide information or perform actions.

### How It Works
Attackers impersonate authority figures such as IT staff, bank officials, or managers to gain trust.

### Impact
- Unauthorized data access
- Privacy violations
- Security breaches

### Real-World Example
Attackers posing as IT support staff asking employees for login credentials during system “maintenance”.

### Prevention
- Verify identity before sharing information
- Follow strict information-sharing policies
- Employee security awareness training

## 3. Baiting Attacks

### Description
Baiting attacks lure victims with something appealing, such as free software, gifts, or USB drives.

### How It Works
Victims are tempted to click malicious downloads or insert infected USB drives into systems.

### Impact
- Malware infection
- System compromise
- Data theft

### Real-World Example
Malicious USB drives labeled “Confidential” dropped in office parking areas.

### Prevention
- Disable unknown USB devices
- Avoid downloading untrusted software
- Implement endpoint security solutions

## Conclusion
Social engineering attacks remain one of the most effective cyber threats because they target human behavior. Technical controls combined with user education are essential to mitigate these attacks.

Understanding social engineering techniques helps security analysts reduce human-related security risks.
